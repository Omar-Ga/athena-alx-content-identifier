Welcome. This video is the first in a four-part series that will guide you in choosing the appropriate visualization based on the information that you want to convey. Data visualizations serve more than one purpose at the beginning of a project data visualizations will help you to understand and analyze your data by showing patterns and trends. At the end of a project data visualizations. Will Aid you in communicating your insights? Suppose you choose an incorrect chart type to visualize your data. You will either miss out on some crucial information or fail to communicate your findings effectively. To guide us through choosing the correct visualization. Let's consider a data set that contains data on the 17 sustainable development goals or sdgs as put together by the United Nations. It includes a data entry for each of the 17 sdgs for 193 countries. The countries are divided into seven regions and each region has an aggregated score known as the sdg index score. We want to create visualizations that will answer the following questions, which region is performing the best considering the sdg index score and you are given a list of five African countries, which country has shown the best Improvement in goalscore one from 2011 to 2021. With both of these visualizations, we want to make a comparison in the first we want to compare the sdg index score for the seven regions in the second. We want to compare how five countries have changed over time concerning goal scorer one. Bar charts and line charts are helpful visualizations to illustrate comparisons. But which do we choose and when? Let's summarize. What each of these visualizations is good for? Bar charts are useful when comparing values for different categories or tracking changes over time and they are most valuable when the changes are large. Your choice between a vertical and horizontal bar chart can be guided by how much text you have to display at the foot of each bar. If you have more text a horizontal display is often more effective. Lion charts are good choice when you want to track changes over time and are the best option when the changes are small with line charts. You can also compare changes over a period of time for more than one group as each group will have its own line. Now that you know more about each type of chart. It's consider the two visualizations. We want to create and decide which chart will be the best option for each visualization. For the first visualization a bar chart will be the best chart to use. We want to see which region is performing the best when looking at the sdg index score at a single point in time. Each region in this case will be a category or bar and the value we are comparing is the sdg index score the score will be the height of each bar. For our second visualization. The best option will be a line chart. We want to see which country is performing the best when looking at the score for goalscore one over a period of time as we mentioned line graphs are good for time series data across multiple groups. Each of the five countries will be aligned and the value or height of the line for each particular year will be the goal one score allowing us to compare the changes of goal scorer one over time for multiple countries. It is essential to be clear on the following information when we choose visualizations. One what do we want to visualize in this case? A comparison two what charts can be used to create this type of visualization? bar charts and line charts 3 understand what each visualization chart is good for to make your final decision. Now that you are comfortable choosing the correct visualization for comparison. Let's move on to the next video, which is on the area of visualization known as composition. We'll see you there.
